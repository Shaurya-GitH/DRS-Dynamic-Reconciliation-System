üîç What is DRS and Why is it Useful?
Communication is the key to successful negotiations, yet miscommunication, deception, and emotional biases often lead to poor decisions. The Decision Reconciliation System (DRS) is a multimodal AI tool that ensures clear, unbiased, and data-driven communication by analyzing:

- Text Sentiment using BERT & GoEmotions for real-time text analysis.
- Speech Emotion using CNN-LSTM & RAVDESS dataset for voice tone analysis.
- Facial Expressions using DeepFace & FER-2013 to detect non-verbal cues.
- Body Language Tracking with OpenPose & MediaPipe for gesture recognition.

üîπ Where can DRS be used?
Business Negotiations: Helps professionals gauge emotions during deals, reducing conflicts and improving outcomes.
Virtual Meetings (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.): Provides real-time feedback on participants' emotions, boosting engagement.
Legal & Security Interrogations: Detects potential deception or emotional stress during interviews.
Mental Health & HR Evaluations: Assists in identifying stress or emotional distress in individuals.
